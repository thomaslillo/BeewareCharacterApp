Character Name Wizard
================

## Description

A simple name generator for D&D players. Using a selection of existing names from different categories (elven names, Hindu gods, global city names, etc.) the app generates new similar sounding names.

#### How It Works
The app uses a Markov chain (or Markov process) to generate word sequences similar to existing sequences. Markov chains are stochastic models that describe a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
